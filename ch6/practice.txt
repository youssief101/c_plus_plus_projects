1- Write a function that determine the factorial of a given number using iteration
2- Write a function that defines a static object that's used to print 1 to 10 inclusive
3- Write a function that defines a static object that's used to print 0 to 10 inclusive
4- Write 3 files, one of them declares the function isPrime in myFunction.h to find if the
number is a prime number or not, then define that function in a file called source.cpp,
then use that function in a file called main.cpp
5- Write a function that points to a specific variable and reset its value
#6- Write a function to swap the values of two ints. test the function by calling it and
printing the swapped values
#7- Write a function to reset a specific value using reference
#8- Write a function that compare the length of two strings
#$9- Write the function find_char that will return the position of the first occurrence of
a given character in a string, and also count how many times the character occurs?
#$10- use the find_char function inside the is_sentence function to find out if the current
string is a sentence 'ends with a .' or not?
#$11- Write a C++ function print that prints an array of characters using the old c style (use pointer)
#$12- Write a C++ function print that prints an array using the std conventions?
#$13- Write a C++ function print that prints an array by direclty passing size parameter?
#14- Write function 'print' that use reference to an array to print it?
15- create print function that prints a multi-dimensional array (array of arrays)?
=========================================================================================================
16- create a program that check if the user has the a valid command line argument of the program cmd.cpp
the program has the arguments -v or --verbose, -c or --count, -i or --input?
17- last time you've created swap function but you didn't encounter if v1, and v2 are equals, create a C++
program that has an explicit return?
18- Write a function that, given a counter, and a word and an ending, gives back the plural version of the
word if the counter is greater than 1?
19- Create a function that returns a reference to the shorter of its two strings ?
20- create a function that changes the first character to anything you want in a string but by assigning to
a function that return a reference to that charcter?
21- create a C++ program that has non-void function that return values machine that we can use to indicate
success or failure?
22- We have created a function factorial() that return the factorial of a given number using iteration, try
to create the function fact() using the recursion instead of iteration?
23- use type alias typedef to create an array of ten ints arrT?
24- use type alias using to create an array of ten ints arrT?
25- Create a function that return a pointer to an array? and print that array in that function?
26- Create a pointer to an array in 4 different method, 1- normal in main, 2- using function, 3- using
trailing return type, 4- using decltype?
27- Create func -that is- a function takes an integer as a parameter, and returns a pointer to an array of
ten integers? == repeat exercise 26 using trailing return type?
28- (very good question) create a C++ program that has function arrPtr that decide which array to point to odd, or
even?
29- Write the delcaration for a function that returns a reference to an array of ten strings without using either
a trailing return, decltype, or a type alias?
30- write three additional declarations for the function in the previous exercise. One should use a type alias
one should use a trailing return, and the third should use decltype, which form do you prefer and why?
