1- in question:
Write a function that defines a static object that's used to print 1 to 10 inclusive

instead of using the data type size_t I used the data type int as the function return
data type, also I used int instead of size_t in the for loop header

mistake
int countCalls() {
correction
size_t countCalls() {

mistake
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
correction
for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
