1- initialize a string in 6 different ways commenting each method
2- write a C++ program that reads string until EOF
3- write a C++ program that reads lines except empty lines, including spaces
4- write a C++ program that read an input at a time and print lines that are
longer than 80 characters.
5- wirte a C++ program that compare these strings together `Hello`,
`Hello World`, `Hiya`.
6- write a C++ program that add 2 strings (concatenate them)?
7- write a C++ program that prints each character in a string("some string")
on a line?
8- write a C++ program that counts how many punctuations chars in a string?
9- write a C++ program that convert each character in a given text to uppercase?
9- write a C++ program that convert each character in a given text to lowercase?
10- write a C++ program that prints the first character in a string?
11- write a C++ program that capitalize the first character in a string?
12- write a C++ program that capitalize the first word in the string?
13- you have numbers between 0 and 15, and you want. write a C++ program that
generate the hexadecimal representation of that number.
======================================================================================
14- Mention the ways to initialize a vector with int values?
15- Mention the ways to initialize a vector with string values?
16- create a vector that contains elements from 0 to 99
17- create a C++ program that read the input, storing the values we read in the vector
to construct a full phrase (words) string?
18- square all the elements in a vector?
19- create a C++ program that count how many grades fall into various clusters of 10
input: 42, 65, 95, 100, 39, 67, 95, 76, 88, 76, 83, 92, 76, 93
output: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1?
20- create a program that add integers to a vector efficiently (decltype)?
21- Read a sequence of words from cin and store the values a vector. After you've read all
the words, process the vector and change each word to uppercase. print the transformed
elements, eight words to a line
22- Read a set of integers into a vector. Print the sum of each pair of adjacent elements
. Change your program so that it prints the sum of the first and last elements, followed
by the sum of the second and second-to-last and so on.
23- Write a program that capitalize the first character of a string using an iterator?
24- Write a program that capitalize a word until encounter a wihtespace or run out of chars
using iterators?
25- Write a C++ program that print each line in text up to the first blank line
26- Write a program to print the size and contents of the vectors from exercise 3.13.
Check whether your answers to that exercise were correct. If not, restudy § 3.3.1 (p. 97)
until you understand why you were wrong using iterator.
27- Read a sequence of words from cin and store the values in a vector. After you’ve read all
the words, process the vector and change each word to uppercase. Print the transformed
elements, eight words to a line using iterators.
