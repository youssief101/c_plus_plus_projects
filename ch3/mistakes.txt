1- in this question:
7- write a C++ program that prints each character in a string("some string")
on a line?

instead of using the method size() for the string, we may use the range based for loop
to loop on each character in the string
mistake:
  for (int i = 0; i != word.size(); ++i)
    cout << word[i] << endl;
correction:
  for (auto c : word)
    cout << c << endl;
    
2- In this question:
9- write a C++ program that convert each character in a given text to uppercase?
I missed to initialize c as a reference so that it changes each character in the string,
also I missed the function toupper() that return the uppercase of a given character
int main() {
  string word = "some string";
  for (auto c : word)
In this question:
10- write a C++ program that prints the first character in a string?
you didn't check if the string is empty and its crucial because trying to access an empty
string for a specific character has an undefined behavior
mistake:
  string word = "some string";
  cout << word[0] << endl;
correction:
  if (!word.empty())
    cout << word[0] << endl;

3- In this question:
11- write a C++ program that capitalize the first character in a string?
you didn't include the cctype header, also you didn't check for the empty string again:
mistake:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

  str[0] = toupper(str[0]);
correction:
#include <cctype>

  if (!str.empty())
    str[0] = toupper(str[0]);
    
4- 12- write a C++ program that capitalize the first word in the string? (you need to review this question)

In this question:
$13- you have numbers between 0 and 15, and you want. write a C++ program that
generate the hexadecimal representation of that number.
you used the data type int instead of string::size_type
mistake:
  int dig;
correction:
  string::size_type n; // hold numbers from the input
also you use the wrong comparison, you used:
mistake:
    if (dig >= 0 && dig <= 15)
correction:
    if (n < hexdigits.size()) // ignore invalid input
also you printed each converted character immidelately while in the program it concatenated
that character in the str
mistake:
      cout << eqHex[dig] << " ";
correction:
      result += hexdigits[n]; // fetch the indicated hex digit

in this question:
19- create a C++ program that count how many grades fall into various clusters of 10
input: 42, 65, 95, 100, 39, 67, 95, 76, 88, 76, 83, 92, 76, 93
output: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1?

I used a useless if statement
mistake:
while (cin >> grade) {
    if (grade < 10)
      ++clusters[0];
    else
      ++clusters[grade / 10];
  }
correction:
while (cin >> grade) {
    if (grade <= 100)
      ++cluster[grade / 10];
  }
